 <h1>Granger, Indiana</h1>
   <section>
    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>I kid you not when I say Granger is Michiana, it's at the top and center of the state.
       My physical house is a 2-5 minute drive from the Michigan Border. It's far but not too far
       from Indy, clocking in at 2 hours and 45 minutes.

    <h2>About</h2>
      <section>
       <h3>Weather</h3>
        Granger is still Indiana, which means the whether could turn on a dime, especially in the early-mid-ish months of the year. You may think winter is gone due to strolling through 3 whole weeks of pleasant weather until it all comes crashing down sometime in April where you get blindsided by a blizzard. This scenario tends to happen more than once, usually twice more.

        <h3>Culver's</h3>
         <p>
          I noticed Indy doesn't have any Culver's but in Granger we have 3. Culver's is basically a more dignified and competent McDonalds in terms of service. McDonalds may have the slight edge in terms of burgers and fries but Culvers more than makes up to it with it's ice cream where, get this, the machine never breaks!

       <h3>The Shire</h3>
         <p>If the state or the country was condensed into a Lord of the Rings map, Granger would for sure be "The Shire" where the happy little hobbits live. It's suburban, green, plenty of fields, incredibly nice neighbors all around and an actual hobbit hole. No joke, on the way to the main road to South Bend, there's a house built into a hill.</p>
