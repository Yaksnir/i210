    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>I kid you not when I say Granger is Michiana, it's at the top and center of the state.
       My physical house is a 2-5 minute drive from the Michigan Border. It's far but not too far
       from Indy, clocking in at 2 hours and 45 minutes.

    <h2>Things to Do.</h2>
    <p>Unless you live/grew up here, there's not much here for you in terms of attractions. South Bend however, the city next
        to Granger, has you covered. More restaraunts, and a few museums and theaters. What the city is most known for is the University of Notre Dame, especially around football season. People love their football. Our favorite passtime here is at a pub called Taphouse on the Edge during TRIVIA NIGHT! Best trivia in the country I think.
